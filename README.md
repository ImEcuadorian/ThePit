# ThePit

## About

ThePit is an FFA PVP game. 
Its gameplay is pretty easy as your main goal is 
to fight and kill the more people you can. 
Every time you get a kill, you will be rewarded 
with XP and gold, depending on your level. With gold, 
you can purchase items, upgrades, and perks which give 
you an advantage whilst fighting others. XP is used to 
level up. Gold can be earned in various ways, the simpler 
one is by killing others but you can also pick it up from 
the ground or claim bounties that are randomly getting 
placed if a player has a high streak. Moreover, with gold, 
you can purchase diamond armor, sword, arrows, and obsidian 
which will help you a lot. Perks are helpful as well as they 
give you a different feeling of playing, you can have golden heads 
instead of golden apples, earn 7x more gold from pick-ups and much more! Finally, 
upgrades will help you more since your blocks will stay longer,
you will earn more XP and gold, or you will deal more damage. 
The gold generators and generally every command will amaze you as you will realise 
how easy it is to use this plugin.
